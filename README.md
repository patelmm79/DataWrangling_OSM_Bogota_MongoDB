I explored, cleansed, and analysed OpenStreetMap data for Bogota, Colombia using MongoDB (via Python).  I selected the city of Bogot√° for a number of reasons. First of all, I know the city
fairly well, having lived there for 4 months. I have a specific interest in the
developing world, and understanding & building the potentially vast but uncollected
data for those parts of the world. Compared to most well-developed countries, which
have a high proportion of the population that are connected to the Internet who serve
as active users and contributors, cities in developing countries have fewer users to
develop and utilize such content.
